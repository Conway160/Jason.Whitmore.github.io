<h3> Introduction</h3>
<body>
<p> Hello everyone my name is Jason Whitmore. I am making this website for my CPT422 Hypertext markup Language Programming class. I am a Tecnical Sergeant in the Air Force with 12
years of experience under my belt. If you do not include basic training or technical school I have been stationed at two different duty locations. My first duty station was <a href="https://www.ellsworth.af.mil/"> Ellsworth
Air Force Base, South Dakota.</a> I was up there for 9 years 2008 until 2017. In 2017 I was lucky and was able to PCS to <a href="https://www.eglin.af.mil/"> Eglin Air Force Base, Florida.</a> The way it looks I will
probably retire here. Lets be real though can you think of a worse place to retire?</p>

<p> I met my wife junior high, at that point in our life we were not huge fans of each other. We started dating in 2003 which would of been my freshman year and her 8th grade year. In 2008 we got married after I had graduated 
from technical school and was in route to our first duty station. In 2009 we had Joseph our first child and then in 2012 we had our second child Jayden. Along with our two wonderful children we have the best dog in the world Sweety.
We found her in the paper in 2008 and have had her ever since. </P

<h3> Hobbies </h3>
<body>
<p> I would say that I have three major hobbies. My first hobbie is more of passion than a hobbie. But wrestling is huge passion of mine, not that <h4><img src="wwf.jfif" alt="World Wrestling Entertainment"></h4> but actual wrestling
<h4><img src="USA Wresting.jpg" alt="USA Wrestling"></h4>. When you watch the Olympics you will see two of the three different styles. You have Freestyle, Greko-Roman, and Folkstyle. Folkstyle is what you see see in High School and 
College, Freestyle and Greko-Roman is what you see in the Olympics and other major world tournaments. I learned way to late how much fun and how much joy I got from teaching kids how to wrestle. I tried to convince my oldest (Jospeh) 
to wrestle for years and he always said no. When his younger brother (Jayden) was older I to finally able to convice Joseph to wrestle. Jayden was still a year to young to wrestle at this point. The following year both of them were
wrestling. Unfortunatly we ended up leaving and have not been able to find youth wrestling program around us down here in Florida. </p>

<p> My second hobbie or passion is football. <h4><img src="osu.jpg" alt="THE Ohio State Buckeyes!"></h4> In college this is the only team I am rooting for. I am a fan but not one of those people who know every detail about the team and
the players. I do not really care for the NFL but I do watch the Cincinatti Bengals, that is mostly because of their quarterback Joe Burrow. Mr. Burrow grew up 10 miles down the road from me so, he is our local hero. Then if you want to
watch the best football go watch some Friday night High School football. Those kids are out there playing because they love the sport and are having fun while doing it. College kids are playing to either pay for school or to try and make
it to the NFL. The NLF players are only playing beacuse they are getting paid to play. </p> 

<p> My third hobby is automovies. I like learning about cars and tinkering with them. It is crazy seeing what kind of technology is coming down the pipe line. If you want to know what kind of technology is coming down the pipe look at
Mercedes. They are typically at the forefront of up and coming technology in passenger cars. My fascination with cars has led me down a rabbit hole with my own car. I currently own a 2004 Infiniti G35 that comes stock with 280hp or 225whp.
After many years of tinkering and modifing my car now makes 620hp or 540whp. I would not have been able to get to this page if it were not for forums. My go to forum is <a href="https://my350z.com/forum/engine-and-drivetrain-50/"> My350z</a>
even though I do not own a 350z. The 350Z and G35 are are mechanically the same, and the 350Z forum has twice the following the G35 forum has. If now if I have G35 specific problems I will go to <a href="https://g35driver.com/forums/tech-area-v35-17/">
G35 Driver.</a> Here is a my car on the dyno getting tuned to make that kind of power. <a href="https://youtu.be/WAqgEO9e_LY"> 04 G35 Dyno Video.</a> I would say that this is by far my most costly hobbie. Even though it has been an expensive endeviour,
 it has been well worth the journey.</p>
