<h3> Introduction</h3>
<body>
<p> Hello everyone my name is Jason Whitmore. I am making this website for my CPT422 Hypertext markup Language Programming class. I am a Tecnical Sergeant in the Air Force with 12
years of experience under my belt. If you do not include basic training or technical school I have been stationed at two different duty locations. My first duty station was <a href="https://www.ellsworth.af.mil/"> Ellsworth
Air Force Base, South Dakota.</a> I was up there for 9 years 2008 until 2017. In 2017 I was lucky and was able to PCS to <a href="https://www.eglin.af.mil/"> Eglin Air Force Base, Florida.</a> The way it looks I will
probably retire here. Lets be real though can you think of a worse place to retire?</p>

<p> I met my wife junior high, at that point in our life we were not huge fans of each other. We started dating in 2003 which would of been my freshman year and her 8th grade year. In 2007 we got married after I had graduated 
from technical school and was in route to our first duty station. In 2009 we had Joseph our first child and then in 2012 we had our second child Jayden. Along with our two wonderful children we have the best dog in the world Sweety.
We found her in the paper in 2009 and have had her ever since. </P

<h3> Hobbies </h3>
<body>
<p> I would say that I have three major hobbies. My first hobbie is more of passion than a hobbie. But wrestling is huge passion of mine, not that <h4><img src="wwf.jfif" alt="World Wrestling Entertainment"></h4> but actual wrestling
<h4><img src="USA Wresting.jpg" alt="USA Wrestling"></h4> kind of like what you see in the olympics.
